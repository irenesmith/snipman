Used to track completed tasks; a project to learn Python; this is my first
Python application. It creates a text file to which "snippets" can be added.
The file name is the date of the next Monday. If today is Mondy, the file
will be dated with next Monday's date.

If a file with that name already exists, it will be opened to add new items
to the file. The simple interface was created with TKinter.
