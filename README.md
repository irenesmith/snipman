# SnipMman Demo Applications

This project was originally created to manage the projects I was working on
as a contractor at Google in New York City. Version 1.0 of [SnipMan](snipManPython/snipManV1/)
was created as a learning exercise when I was teaching myself development in
the Python language. Now I will be porting the little application to multiple
languages including the latest version of Python, C#, and JavaScript.

## SnipMan Python version 1.0

Used to track completed tasks; a project to learn Python; this is my first
Python application. It creates a text file to which "snippets" can be added.
The file name is the date of the next Monday. If today is Mondy, the file
will be dated with next Monday's date.

If a file with that name already exists, it will be opened to add new items
to the file. The simple interface was created with TKinter.

## SnipMan Python version 2.0

*Under development* - I'm in the process of updating SnipMan to use Pygame and
Pygwidgets instead of the Tkinter interface library.
